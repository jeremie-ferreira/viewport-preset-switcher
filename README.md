# Viewport Preset Switcher

## Overview

**Viewport Preset Switcher** is a Blender add-on that allows you to easily switch between different camera clipping presets directly from the 3D Viewport. This is especially useful for artists and animators who frequently switch between close-up and distant views while working on their scenes.

## Features

- **Close Camera Preset**: Set a near clipping distance with a range of small values, ideal for close-up shots.
- **Distant Camera Preset**: Set a far clipping distance, suitable for wide-angle or distant views.
- Easy access through a custom panel in the 3D Viewport's `View` tab.
